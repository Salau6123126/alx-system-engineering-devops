# Shell Basics

## Here, we go through the basics of the shell which includes:
* the use of the shebang
* how to navigate around the shell
* how to handle processes in a directory and file
* how to manipulate files
* how to work with commands, by making use of the ```type```, ```which```, ```help```, and ```man``` commands
